    <h1>Git Quiz</h1>
    <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
    <p>Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle
    small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple
    developers to work together on non-linear development.</p>
    <h4>What's a branch and why do we create them?</h4>
    <p>n Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of
    your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to
    encapsulate your changes.</p>
    <h4>What's the working tree?</h4>
    <p>The working tree, or working directory, consists of files that you are currently working on.</p>
    <h4>What's the staging area?</h4>
    <p>The working area is where files that are not handled by git. These files are also referred to as "untracked files."
    Staging area is files that are going to be a part of the next commit, which lets git know what changes in the file are
    going to occur for the next commit.</p>
    <h4>What's the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve?</h4>
    <p>The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.</p>
